This is to compare our results with the original paper
1. The energy in our paper and the activity dimension in the original paper have similar acoustic correlates. This can be seen the Entropy and Flux features
2. ZCR feature can be seen correlating similarly with warmth and colourfulness in both th p papers.
3. Just like the original paper, MFCCs did nit correlate higly with any of the perceptual dimensions.
4. Unlike the previous paper, warmth correlated moderately with spectral centroid feature.
